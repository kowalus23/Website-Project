Inspiration was retro style and typical pixels games like Snake, puzzle, invaders etc. In the future i'm planning to add some extra games.

`EDIT: I came back to my project after at least a year, and fixing took me like 2minutes to read the code and to fix it, i added some extra things (will update it more in future`

At the end we've got "leader-board" which also suppose to have fetch with local leaderboards. But since my skill are really fresh, i'm still learning, and as soon as i'll gather more knowledge about, and i'll find time to fix all issues, i'll do that for sure!.

Thanks for visiting!
