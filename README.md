Inspiration was retro style and typical pixels games like Snake, puzzle, invaders etc. In the future i'm planning to add some extra games.
While adding more code, my snake caught issue in case of movement... will try to fix it, i set growth for "max" to show collision and what's happens after.

Test option was, a different one rebuild, but it needs fruit, colission system and few other things.

At the end we've got "leader-board" which also suppose to have fetch with local leaderboards. But since my skill are really fresh, i'm still
learning, and as soon as i'll gather more knowledge about, and i'll find time to fix all issues, i'll do that for sure!.

Thanks for visiting!
