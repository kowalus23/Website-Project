# Website-Project

> Website with game, ending course project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9010
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

Technologies used in this project, are mainly React.js with Sass.

When you'll open this Project, you have to click title of the game to run game of your choice. First it was made on the button, but since it's checkbox i change my mind to make it by react's routes. 

In near future, i want to fix that checkbox, also have to sort out snake's movement or rebuild whole system (creating map, growing up and movement through).

P.s. only Snake is able to choose, planning to add Puzzle or Tetris instead :) keep watching
